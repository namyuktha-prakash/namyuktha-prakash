## Hi, I'm Namyuktha! ðŸ‘‹
ðŸš€ About Me

I'm an undergraduate biomedical engineering student exploring how computation can drive impact at the intersection of biology, health, and technology. Iâ€™m especially drawn to applying machine learning and data-driven methods to understand complex biological systemsâ€”from molecules to human health.

## Recent Projects
1. State of Health (SOH) Prediction for Lithium-Ion Batteries
- This project focused on building deep learning models (MLP, CNN, LSTM) to predict the state of health (SOH) of lithium-ion batteries using the Sandia National Labs dataset. I preprocessed large-scale time-series and cycle summary data, engineered features, and trained predictive models to assess battery degradation under different cycling conditions. The work combines battery systems knowledge with advanced ML techniques for real-world applications in energy storage and sustainability.

2. Predicting Life Satisfaction from Socioeconomic Indicators
- This project applies supervised regression to predict national life satisfaction scores (Life Ladder) using global socioeconomic indicators. Using the World Happiness Report dataset, I built and evaluated linear and regularized regression models like Ridge to understand how features like GDP, social support, freedom, and trust correlate with well-being. Feature selection and model tuning were employed to enhance performance and elucidate the social determinants of happiness.

## ðŸ’» Technologies & Tools
Here are some of the technologies and tools I work with:

Languages: Python, HTML, CSS, C++, Java, Javascript, Matlab, R

Tools: VS Code, Eclipse, Jupyter Notebooks, R-studio
